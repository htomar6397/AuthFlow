   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
# Server

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

### Base URL

```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Authentication

All protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot-reload
- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to serverless environment
- `npm run deploy:prod` - Deploy to serverless environment
- `npm run offline` - Run serverless offline for local development
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Serverless Framework installed globally

### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Deploy to AWS Lambda:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod  
   ```

## Security Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique secrets for JWT and other sensitive data
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your secrets and keys

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB connection issues**: Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string is correct
- **Email delivery problems**: Check your SMTP credentials and ensure your email service allows less secure apps
- **Rate limiting**: If you hit rate limits, adjust the rate limiting configuration in `.env`

## System Analysis and Design

This project is a well-architected and secure authentication service. It's built with a clear separation of concerns and includes multiple layers of security, making it suitable for a production environment.

### Architectural Pattern

The application follows a classic, service-oriented architecture to ensure the codebase is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain:

- **Routes (`/routes`):** Define the API endpoints and link them to the appropriate middleware and controllers.
- **Middleware (`/middleware`):** Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and application-specific flow control.
- **Controllers (`/controller`):** Orchestrate the business logic by validating input, calling services, and formatting the final API response.
- **Services (`/services`):** Contain the core, reusable business logic (e.g., creating JWTs, sending emails), keeping the controllers lean.
- **Models (`/models`):** Define the database schemas using Mongoose, ensuring data consistency at the database level.

### Security Deep Dive

Security is a core feature, with several mechanisms working in concert to protect the application and its users:

- **Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection:** The API uses `rate-limiter-flexible` to apply strict, IP-based rate limits to sensitive endpoints. This is the first line of defense against automated attacks and API abuse. The current implementation is in-memory; for a multi-server deployment, this should be migrated to a distributed store like Redis.

  | Endpoint Category          | Rate Limit            | Description                                     |
  | :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
  | General Auth (`/api/auth`) | 20 requests / 15 min  | Protects against general auth-related abuse.    |
  | Account Creation           | 5 requests / hour     | Prevents mass account creation.                 |
  | Password Reset             | 5 requests / hour     | Prevents email spam for password resets.        |
  | Verify OTP                 | 5 requests / hour     | Protects against OTP brute-force attacks.       |
  | Resend OTP                 | 3 requests / hour     | Prevents email flooding for OTP requests.       |
  | Username Check             | 30 requests / 1 min   | Allows for quick username availability checks.  |
  | Default (All Other APIs)   | 100 requests / 15 min | General API rate limit for authenticated users. |

- **Account Lockout:** As a secondary defense against brute-force attacks, user accounts are temporarily locked for 30 minutes after 5 consecutive failed login attempts.

- **Secure Authentication Flow:**
  - **JWT Strategy:** The system uses short-lived access tokens (15m) and long-lived refresh tokens (7d).
  - **Refresh Token Rotation:** Each time a refresh token is used, it is invalidated and a new one is issued. This helps detect token theft and enhances security.
  - **Secure Cookie Storage:** Refresh tokens are stored in `httpOnly` cookies, which prevents them from being accessed by client-side JavaScript and mitigates the risk of XSS attacks.

- **Data & Password Security:**
  - **Input Validation:** All incoming data is validated and sanitized using `express-validator` to prevent common vulnerabilities like XSS and injection attacks.
  - **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are securely hashed using `bcrypt`, the industry-standard algorithm for password storage.

### Developer Experience & Robustness

- **Centralized Error Handling:** A global error handler (`globalErrorHandler`) and a custom `AppError` class ensure that all errors are handled gracefully and returned in a consistent JSON format.
- **Consistent API Responses:** A standardized response format for both success (`sendSuccess`) and error messages simplifies client-side integration and improves the developer experience.

| `/api/auth/check-username`   | `GET`  | Checks if a username is already in use.      |
| `/api/auth/logout`           | `POST` | Logs the user out.                           |
| `/api/user/profile`          | `GET`  | Retrieves the authenticated user's profile.  |
| `/api/user/complete-profile` | `POST` | Completes the profile for a new user.        |
